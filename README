This is project contains several scripts and programs to identify interesting 
characterisitcs in signers' voices. 

First, a wav file is loaded into matlab and processed into mel frequency 
cepstral coefficients and their composite transfer function is estimated using
an auto regressive filter. 
Then we output this data into a csv file and run a quadratic SVM on this data. 



We utilize LibSVM and Dan Ellis' melfcc calculator.
