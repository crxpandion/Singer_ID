This library contains functions that will create feature vectors to be used
to train classifiers to identify singers. 

ProcessSampleAsCC will take a sample and produce a feature vector using 
cepestral coefficients.

ProcessSampleAsF will take a sample and produce a feature vector using 
formants.
