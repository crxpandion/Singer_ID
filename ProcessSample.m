function [feature_vector] = ProcessSample(sample)
% This function needs to do a couple of things first off it needs to
% caculate the instantaneous frequency and amplitude. Then it needs to
% perform the CTF estimation based off of the approach suggested in B & W.
% We should be able to use the frequency estimators in
% http://tftb.nongnu.org/
% To determine our ifreq and iamp
