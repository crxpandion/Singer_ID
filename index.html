      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        Identifying and differentiating the voices of individual singers is a
        task that comes naturally to humans. Consider the following recordings
        of two singers:
      </p>
      <div class='row'>
        <div class='span-one-third'>
          <h3>Singer 1</h3>
          <audio controls='controls'>
            <source src='audio/mezzo2-excerpt.wav' type='audio/wav'></source>
            Your browser does not support the audio tag.
          </audio>
        </div>
        <div class='span-one-third'>
          <h3>Singer 2</h3>
          <audio controls='controls'>
            <source src='audio/tenor1-excerpt.wav' type='audio/wav'></source>

          </audio>
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        Clearly, Singer 1 and Singer 2 are not the same person. Even after
        hearing only a short excerpt of each singer, we can distinguish between
        the two. We can deduce information about the singers, like their sexes or
        perhaps even their voice types. The task is somewhat more challenging with
        shorter samples given out of context, like the three below.

      <p>
        Even out of context, humans can usually differentiate between different
        singers' voices by the timbre, or quality, of the voice.  One of the
        most important components of what a human listener perceives as timbre
        is the spectral envelope of the singer's voice. The peaks of that to
        identify a singer is particularly useful because, as
        <a href='http://www.lma.cnrs-mrs.fr/~kronland/Sense_of_Sound/49690159.pdf'>Khine, Nwe, and Li</a>
        explain, "studies suggest that timbre is invariant with an individual
        singer."
      </p>
      <p>
        This project explores the application of machine learning to develop an automated singer identifier, largely following
        the methodology of
        <a href='http://home.earthlink.net/~bartscma/caruso.pdf'>Wakefield and Bartsch.</a>
        There many applications for this kind of automated singer identification, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Source differentiation in audio recordings</li>
        <li>Identification of a singers presence on an unlabeled track.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One of the problems in trying to develop such a classifier is the question of how to quantify
        the timbral features of an audio recording for training and classification. In this project, we compare
        the performacne of compositie transfer functions (CTFs) as proposed by
        <a href='http://home.earthlink.net/~bartscma/caruso.pdf'>Wakefield and Bartsch</a>
        and Mel frequency cepstral coefficients, as used by
        <a href='http://ismir2000.ismir.net/papers/logan_abs.pdf'>Logan.</a>

      <h2>Data Set</h2>
      <p>
        We recruited volunteer singers to be recorded and included as part of our
        data set.  We recorded a total of 11 classically trained singers from
        Northwestern University Bienen School of Music consisting of 3 sopranos,
        4 mezzo-sopranos, 2 tenors and 2 baritones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each singer was asked to sing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>The first 5 notes of a major scale.</li>
        <li>Repeated in the low, middle and high regions of the singerâ€™s range.</li>
        <li>Repeated for each of the 5 common Italian language vowels [a], [e], [i], [o], and [u]</li>
      </ul>
      <p>A single scale sounded like this (recorded at 44.1KHz, 16 bits/sample):</p>
      <audio controls='controls'>
        <source src='audio/tenor2-a.wav' type='audio/wav'></source>
        Your browser does not support the audio tag.
      </audio>
      <p>
        These scales were then manually split into single-ptched, 1-second samples, totalling 825 samples (75 per singer).

        The plots above show confusion matrices for the CTF approximation
        method (left) and the MFCC method (right). It is clear that MFCCs
        were more successful at classifying our samples.

      <h3>Classification Levels</h3>
      <div class='row boxplots'>
        <div class='span5'>
          <p>
            The box plots shown right summarize our learnerâ€™s ability to
            classify data samples at one of three levels:
            <a href='https://github.com/crxpandion/Singer_ID/raw/master/figures/boxplots/SingerClassBox.png'>individuals</a>
            (top left),
            <a href='https://github.com/crxpandion/Singer_ID/raw/master/figures/boxplots/SingerTypeClassBox.png'>voice type</a>
            (top right), and
            <a href='https://github.com/crxpandion/Singer_ID/raw/master/figures/boxplots/SexClassBox.png'>sex</a>
            (bottom left). As the classification
            becomes more general, the machine is more successful. There are
            several interesting conclusions to be drawn:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Very good at identifying sex</li>
            <li>Voice type and individual identification are more challenging</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Further investigation revealed that the
            <strong>majority of voice type and individual errors occurred amongst the female samples,</strong>
            as can be seen in the
            <a href='https://github.com/crxpandion/Singer_ID/raw/master/figures/Confusion/Cepstral_all_Confusion.png'>individual confusion matrix</a>
            and the
            <a href='https://github.com/crxpandion/Singer_ID/raw/master/figures/Confusion/Cepstral_Type_Confusion.png'>voice type confusion matrix</a>
            (bottom right). The reasons for this are of
            great interest to us.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <h3>Sparse spectra:</h3>
      <p>
        As
        <a href='http://home.earthlink.net/~bartscma/caruso.pdf'>Wakefield and Bartsch</a>
        explain, the female voice typically has a higher
        fundamental frequency, such that the spectral envelopes generated by the female
        singers are sparser than those of the male singers. These sparse spectra
        likely contribute to our difficulty in classifying female voices. The plot
        below shows the CTF of the two audio samples given for a soprano and a
        mezzo-soprano and demonstrates how the similarities could cause
        confusion.

      <h3>Voice maturity</h3>
      <p>
        The age and maturity of our sample set must also be considered in evaluating
        the results. A young womanâ€™s voice can continue to change and develop into her
        30â€™s. As such, it is not uncommon for young female singers to change voice
        types early in their career. Our vocalists are all under the age of 30 and our
        youngest singer, Mezzo3, is currently considering transitioning to soprano
        repertoire. Thus our results are more vulnerable to voice type discrepancies
        than a sample set of fully developed vocalists.
      </p>
      <h3>Future research opportunities:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Could machines trained on matured singers help voice teachers identify the voice type of young students, particularly pre-mature females?</li>
        <li>How will a learner perform when the sample set contains more specific fachs such as coloratura soprano, lyric soprano, spinto soprano, and soubrette?</li>
